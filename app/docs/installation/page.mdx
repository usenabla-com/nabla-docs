# Install Nabla

Download signed binaries directly from our CDN and pin the exact version you want. Use the tabs to choose a platform and the dropdown to choose a version — the command updates automatically.

<InstallCommand />

## Next steps

- Make the binary executable and place it on your PATH: `chmod +x ./nabla && sudo mv ./nabla /usr/local/bin/`
- Verify the install: `nabla --version`
- Checksums, signatures, and package managers will be documented here soon.

## Verify signatures with Cosign

Nabla binaries are signed. A detached signature file `nabla.sig` is published alongside each binary. Verify the binary before installing.

### 1. Install Cosign

- macOS: `brew install cosign`
- Linux: use your package manager or see Sigstore docs.

### 2. Download signature and public key

Replace the platform and version to match what you downloaded from the tabs above.

```bash
# Example values — change to match your download
VERSION=v1.1.0
PLATFORM=nabla-macos-arm64   # or nabla-macos-amd64, nabla-linux-amd64

# Download the signature that sits next to the binary
curl -fL https://cdn.usenabla.com/${PLATFORM}-${VERSION}/nabla.sig -o nabla.sig

# Download the trusted Cosign public key
curl -fL https://cdn.usenabla.com/cosign.pub -o cosign.pub
```

### 3. Verify the signature

```bash
# Verify the downloaded binary using the detached signature and public key
cosign verify-blob \
  --key cosign.pub \
  --signature nabla.sig \
  nabla

# Expected: output indicates verification success
```

If verification fails, do not run the binary. Re‑download and re‑verify, or contact support.

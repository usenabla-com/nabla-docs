# Welcome to Nabla

Nabla helps teams ship safer software by evaluating code, binaries, and configuration against clear policy. It produces deterministic, auditâ€‘friendly results you can use locally and in CI to make fast, consistent decisions.

<Callout type="info">New here? Start with Installation, then take the Architecture Overview tour. When ready, run your first evaluation with the CLI.</Callout>

## What is Nabla?

- A policyâ€‘driven evaluation engine that turns observable evidence into explainable outcomes.
- A CLI you can run locally or in CI/CD to gate changes and generate reports.
- A simple configuration model for selecting policies, scoping inputs, and tuning outputs.

## Why teams use it

- Consistent decisions: deterministic rule execution and policy mapping.
- Developer friendly: fast local runs with the same behavior as CI.
- Audit ready: humanâ€‘readable summaries and machine outputs (JSON/SARIF).
- Extensible: tailor policies, controls, and rules to your environment.

## How it works (at a glance)

1. Discover inputs: repositories, artifacts, binaries, or supplied metadata.
2. Resolve policy: map selected policies to controls and rules for the run.
3. Execute rules: evaluate evidence deterministically with pinned versions.
4. Aggregate results: normalize severities and remediation guidance.
5. Enforce and publish: fail CI when configured and export reports.

## Quick start

- Install the CLI: ðŸ”— <a className="font-bold" href="/docs/installation">Installation</a>
- Understand the moving parts: ðŸ”— <a className="font-bold" href="/docs/highlevel-overview">Architecture Overview</a>
- Run and script it: ðŸ”— <a className="font-bold" href="/docs/cli-reference">CLI Reference</a>

## Core concepts

- <a href="/docs/rules">Rules</a>: atomic checks that evaluate facts.
- <a href="/docs/controls">Controls</a>: practical requirements implemented by one or more rules.
- <a href="/docs/configuration">Configuration</a>: select policy, scope inputs, set parameters.
- <a href="/docs/outputs">Outputs</a>: summaries, JSON, SARIF, and markdown.

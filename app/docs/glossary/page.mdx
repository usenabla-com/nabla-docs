# Glossary

This glossary clarifies the terms you’ll see in the CLI, outputs, and policy assessments.

### Artifact
An input to analysis. Can be a single binary, an archive, or a directory containing binaries and related files.

### Assessment
High‑level evaluation of mapped controls against observed evidence. Produced by `nabla assess` as JSON (see Outputs & Reporting → Assessment report).

### BinaryAnalysis
The structured record Nabla builds for each analyzed artifact (format, arch, symbols, strings, libraries, hashes, sections, metadata). Rules and assessments consume this to produce findings and control statuses.

### Confidence (score)
A numeric indicator (0–1) expressing confidence in an assessment outcome or finding, based on signal quality and corroboration. Not a direct measure of business risk.

### Config (configuration)
YAML settings that control scanning and policy behavior. Default path: `./.nabla/config.yaml`. CLI flags override config values.

### Control
An actionable requirement that maps one or more rules to a governance objective. Controls roll up to policies and receive an implementation status in assessments.

### Control status
Implementation outcome for a control during assessment: `implemented`, `partially-implemented`, or `not-applicable`.

### CWE
Common Weakness Enumeration identifiers attached to relevant findings in SARIF.

### CSPRNG
Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (e.g., `getrandom`, `arc4random`, CTR_DRBG). Prefer for keys/tokens/nonces.

### Evidence
Signals observed during analysis (e.g., symbols, strings, libraries, section flags). Summarized and capped in outputs to keep reports readable.

### Evidence tier
Qualifies a finding’s basis: `observed` (direct evidence) or `heuristic` (inferred patterns). Heuristic items can be excluded with `--exclude-heuristics`.

### Finding
An individual rule result (e.g., “weak_crypto_algorithms”) with a level, message, properties, and optional locations in SARIF.

### Framework
A compliance or best‑practice standard that policies tailor messaging to (e.g., GSMA IoT, ETSI EN 303 645, FIPS 140‑3, NIST SP 800‑53/800‑193, FDA Premarket).

### Heuristic
Inference‑based signal that suggests a condition (e.g., likely flash encryption). Marked as heuristic in outputs; can be filtered out.

### Help URI
Link from a rule to its documentation (e.g., `/docs/rules#weak_crypto_algorithms`). Appears in SARIF rule registry and in findings.

### Level (severity)
Finding importance used for filtering and exit behavior. Levels: `low`, `medium`, `high`.

### Minimum level (`--min-level`)
Output filter that hides findings below a given level without changing evaluation (useful for concise reports).

### Policy
Collection of controls aligned to a governance objective or framework. Policies determine how individual findings roll up to an outcome.

### Redaction
Removes sensitive local paths or details from output. Enable with `--redact-paths` for shareable CI logs.

### Remediation
Actionable guidance attached to a finding describing how to resolve the issue.

### Rule
Deterministic check that inspects BinaryAnalysis and emits a finding (with severity, message, and properties). See Rules for the registry and details.

### SARIF
Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (JSON) for tool‑agnostic reporting. Nabla emits SARIF via `--output sarif`.

### SBOM
Software Bill of Materials. Nabla can generate CycloneDX SBOMs with `nabla sbom --from <path|url>`.

### Signed update
An update mechanism that verifies signatures before applying code or firmware. Related to the `signed_update_support` rule and update policies.

### Secure boot
Boot process that verifies code before execution using a root of trust. Related to `secure_boot_present` and policy assessments for authenticity.

### Strings limit (`--strings-limit`)
Caps how many embedded strings are collected per file to control performance and output size.

### Summary report
Human‑readable overview (Markdown recommended) showing top risks, counts, and links to rule docs. Enable with `--summary md`.

### Timeout (`--timeout-ms`)
Per‑file analysis time budget in milliseconds. Helps bound worst‑case processing.

### TLS
Transport Layer Security. Prefer HTTPS/TLS over plaintext protocols (see `insecure_protocol_http`).

### W^X
Writable‑xor‑Executable memory policy. Findings like `writable_executable_section` indicate sections that are both writable and executable.

### Work concurrency (`--concurrency`)
Maximum parallel workers used during analysis.
